Modern Javascript by Example
============================

## Written by Ben Junya

# Introduction

In its humble beginnings, Javacript was seen as a toy, a joke, some scripting language that no one really wanted to screw around with, and in all honestly, they were right. Why use a single-threaded, event driven, asynchronous language with all it's weird callback and event looping, when you could do everything synchronously with Java, C#, or Python? Why bother with all the craziness of abusing `setTimeout`, or bothering with the bullshit of loading in a million script files until your `<head />` exploded? Why?

Over time, languages and tools evolved, and as the web grew in size and complexity, more people started needing to become proficient in Javascript, and the front end started getting really complicated... Gone were libraries that you could load in with a `<script />` tag, and now we have frameworks, bundling systems, entire deployment systems all built in Javascript.

While some old crotchety people will still balk and gripe with "oh it's not a real language" and stick to whatever language they're most familiar with, they, or someone on their team will have to work with Javascript at one point or another. It's grown so large that it's impossible to ignore today.

As the web evolved, so did the language, and Javascript for myself, and my colleagues has been an absolutely wonderful pleasure to work with. It took years of study, discipline, research, and training to get here, but here we are... Javascript... Is moving... Way... Too... Fast...

It's moving so fast, that some of my favorite books like "Eloquent Javascript" and "Javascript - The Good Parts" have fallen behind. The language is constantly evolving, and the more I read about it, I find there to be little to no concrete examples that involve real production level code... Or the actual real-world use cases for all the new features of the language. In my years of teaching programming bootcamps, leading a development team, and reviewing millions of lines of Javascript to my coworkers + colleagues, I have noticed a serious lack of resource of code examples and real world pieces of code that demonstrate the **how** and **why** all these new pieces are important. There's unfortunately few examples out there of all these incredible new features of Javascript, and what makes Javascript a fun language to thoroughly enjoy and work with on a daily basis.

This book attempts to put in as many real world examples from some of the most popular libraries and tools of the time into an easy to digest format so that all programmers, regardless of their skill level can enjoy and take value from.

# Prerequisites

This is meant to be an intermediate book on Javascript. You should already know some of the basics of the language before jumping into this book. We won't take too much time to discuss the basics, as this book is intended to be a guide to intermediate and advanced Javascript tools and techniques.

If you know:

* Higher Order Functions
* Basic Array methods
  * indexOf() and/or includes()
  * push() and pop()
  * slice()
  * splice()
  * shift() and unshift()
  * reverse()
  * sort() and filter()
* Basic String methods
  * split()
  * slice()
* Closures

You should be alright.

If you feel moderately comfortable with a popular modern framework like `React`, `Angular 2+`, or `Vue.js`, you should be in pretty good shape too. We'll use as many real world examples with these frameworks throughout this book, not just the front end UI stuff, but backend Node scripts and servers as well.

# Navigating the Book

Like many other developers, my eyes immediately move towards snippets of code. This book attempts to show as many examples as possible and keep the non-coding chat to a minimum. All important topics are in header tags for easy maneuvering and link-ability for sending information to colleagues and coworkers.
