Modern Javascript by Example
============================

# Introduction

In its humble beginnings, Javacript was seen as a toy, a joke, some scripting language that no one really wanted to screw around with, and in all honestly, they were right. Why use a single-threaded, event driven, asynchronous language with all it's weird callback and event looping, when you could do everything synchronously with Java, C#, or Python? Why bother with all the craziness of abusing `setTimeout`, or bothing with the bullshit of loading in a million script files until your <head /> exploded? Why?

Over time, languages and tools evolved, and as the web grew in size and complexity, more people started needing to become proficient in Javascript, and the front end started getting really complicated... Gone were libraries that you could load in with a <script /> tag, and now we have frameworks, bundling systems, entire deployment systems all built in Javascript.

While some old crotchety men or women will still balk and gripe with "oh it's not a real language" and stick to whatever language they're most familiar with, they, or someone on their team will have to work with Javascript at one point or another. It's grown so large that it's impossible to ignore today.

As the web evolved, so did the language, and Javascript for myself, and my colleages has been an absolutely wonderful pleasure to work with. It took years of study, discipline, research, and training to get here, but here we are... Javascript... Is moving... Way... Too... Fast...

It's moving so fast, that some of my favorite books like "Eloquent Javascript" and "Javascript - The Good Parts" have fallen behind. The language is constantly evolving, and the more I read about it, I find there to be little to no concrete examples that involve real production level code... Or the actual real-world use cases for all the new features of the language. In my years of teaching and mentoring from bootcamps to my coworkers + colleagues, I've found a lack of resource of code examples and real world pieces of code to show the **how** and **why** all these new pieces are important and how they can make Javascript truly a language to thoroughly enjoy and work with on a daily basis.

This book attempts to put in as many real world examples from some of the most popular libraries and tools of the time into an easy to digest format so that all programmers regardless of skill level can enjoy and take value from.
