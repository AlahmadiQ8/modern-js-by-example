Architecting a Javascript Application
=====================================

In this section, we'll detail out all the goals from start to finish on creating a fully functional Javascript application from front to back, using a single page application that lives client-side, and a fairly straightforward server + database running in NodeJs.

This section will be split up in two sections - the front end, and the back end.

## Nailing the front end

When I'm architecting out a brand new Javascript single page application, there's over a thousand different variables and thoughts going through my head, but it's important to really focus on just the 5 or 6 important questions. The remaining 995 questions are just noise.

Here's my general checklist of what needs to happen before even thinking about build systems or frameworks:

### 1. What's the development environment going to look like?

When you're building out the development environment and setting everything up, you'll want things like:
* Source Maps
* 
*

### 2. What's the production environment going to look like?

### 3. How are the dev or production environments going to be deployed?


## Nailing the back end


## What about Server-Side Rendering?

I get this question a ton, and there's a few things one needs to keep in mind before even thinking about server-side rendering:

1. Do I need SEO from all search engines and not just Google?
2. How important is my page load speed?
