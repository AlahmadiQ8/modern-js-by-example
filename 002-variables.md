Variables and Simple Data Types
===============================

Let's talk basics of the basics.

## String

Strings are text. They're surrounded by either
* Single quotation marks ('') or
* Double quotation marks ("")  or
* Backticks (``) - They're to the left of the "1" key on your keyboard

```js
'Hello! I am a string'
"I am also a string"
`Me too. We are all strings`
```

## Number

Numbers are... Numbers. They represent numerical value.

```js
10
-1
200192003
5
```

These are all numbers.

## Booleans

Straightforward either true, or false

```js
true
false
```
